# FullStackDev

# Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).

At first, Express HTML was used to show how the site is run from JavaScript. Visual Studio Code was an excellent way to keep track of all of the folders and files needed. Then, we used SPA and added even more files to support the application. The application was then able to load faster and use resources that pertained to specific areas of the page, rather than the whole page itself.

# Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

NoSQL was used with the MongoDB database better scaling, more support, and ease of use for programmers.

# How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

JSON is different from JavaScript in that it follows stricter syntax and mainly focuses on moving information, rather than creating it. JSON ties together frontend and backend by creating an easy way for the user to access information.

# Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

One specific instance when I refactored code to improve functionality was with handlebars. In essence, handlebars are created as its own file to speed up the process and put more details into each part that the handlebars are implemented.

# Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

In a full stack application, methods, endpoints, and security play a large role. Security is important because if the application is left open, it not only allows intruders to steal information, but it also breaks laws if sensitive data is stolen and proper precautions were not taken. The endpoints must be secure, as well as where they originate from. There should be protocols set to keep each part of the application secure.

# How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

This course has helped me by giving me an overall understanding of how applications are formed and used through an SPA. I have learned how to use the different applications and how each one interacts with the other one, by testing to find problems that can't necessarily be seen right away on the webpage. This class helps my understanding of full stack applications for interviews as well.
